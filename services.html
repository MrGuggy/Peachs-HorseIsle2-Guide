  <dd>- NarrowTon General Store has the highest selling prices for average items.</dd>
  <dd>- No general store salesperson will give you money for Demeterâ€™s Cornucopias or Unusual Bugs.</dd>
  <dd>- You can't sell trash to the General Store, but you have a chance get $25 per piece at a trash can. You can also get <abbr title="Experience Points">exp</abbr> when you put trash into the trash can. Because of this, many players sell trash to eachother for the chance of exp.
  <dd>- Gelding services are available at a vet's office for $1000 a stallion, though due to the pros and cons of gelding, as well as the fact that it is irreversible, it is incredibly unpopular.
  <dd>- The maximum available payouts at the job board in City Hall are per each job, not overall (ie. you can work 10 times at both samesame and construction and get paid in full for both).
