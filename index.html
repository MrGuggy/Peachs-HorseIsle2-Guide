   <h2> Welcome to Peach's HI2 Guide </h2>
  </section>
  <section>
<p>
This website contains the more technical information of HI2 that isn't found on any other help site, including the forums of HI2 itself. While <abbr title= "Horse Isle 2 LifeCycle">HI2 LC</abbr> is an older game, there is often error in codes and lack of information for many aspects, or the information is clunky and hard to find/use easily. 
</p>
<p>
The kind of information you'll find in this website is breed spawning information, breed arena bonuses, spawning maps, and other helpful info sorted into groups for easy searching and reference.
</p>
<p>
I should also state that I do <strong>NOT</strong> own Horse Isle. While much of the information I will be listing here can be found in the <abbr title= "Big Book of Breeds">BBB</abbr>, that tool is known for being time consuming and a bit frustrating, especially since you have to look at individual horse breeds instead of being able to group information. My website also provides helpful info such as NPC information (who sells what) and maps of horse spawn points, <em>though please keep in mind this is not "official" data and may not be 100% accurate.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>These are meant as tools, not walkthroughs</strong>.
